    question: "What does custom software development cost?",
    answer:
      "Project costs vary based on complexity and scope, typically ranging from $10,000 for simple business tools to $75,000+ for fully comprehensive systems. I provide detailed estimates after understanding your specific needs and always discuss budget upfront to ensure we're on the same page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I structure payments around project milestones, so you're never paying for work that hasn't been completed. Most projects are split into 3-4 payments over the development timeline. An example payment schedule might look like this: 25% upfront, 50% at milestones, 25% at completion.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do projects typically take?",
    answer:
      "Simple applications usually take 6-12 weeks, while comprehensive business systems can take 3-6 months. I provide realistic timelines upfront and keep you updated on progress throughout.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my needs change during development?",
    answer:
      "I build flexibility into every project plan. Minor adjustments are included, and I'll always discuss costs for significant changes before implementing them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own the source code?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You'll own all code, designs, and intellectual property created for your project. I also provide documentation so you're never locked into working only with me.",
  },
  {
    question: "How involved will I need to be?",
    answer:
      "I handle all the technical complexity, but I'll need your input on business requirements and feedback during development. Most clients spend 1-2 hours per week in meetings and reviews.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I specialize in integrating new solutions with your current tools and databases. I'll assess your existing setup during our initial consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if something breaks after launch?",
    answer:
      "I include a 90-day warranty on all work, and I offer ongoing maintenance plans for long-term support. Since I'm local, I can respond quickly when you need help.",
  },

  {
    question: "What if we're not happy with the results?",
    answer:
      "I work in phases with regular check-ins specifically to prevent this. You'll see and approve everything before we move forward. My goal is building long-term relationships, not one-time projects.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have references?",
    answer:
      "I'm happy to provide references from previous clients and showcase relevant work samples during our consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts?",
    answer:
      "Yes! I offer discounts for non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and churches. Let's discuss your specific situation during our consultation.",

          <p>
            I'm a NYC-born software engineer and current Director of Engineering
            at a healthcare technology company, with deep experience building
            systems that businesses depend on every day. Now I'm bringing that
            expertise directly to local businesses in our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having worked in everything from startups to highly regulated
            industries, I understand that every business has unique challenges.
            I take the time to really understand your operations, then design
            software that makes your work easier, not harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a NY Capital Region resident for the past 7 years, I'm invested
            in seeing our local businesses thrive. When you work with me, you're
            not just hiring a developer—you're partnering with someone who cares
            about your success and is right here in the community when you need
            support.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not working on your next big project, you'll find me
            coworking in downtown Troy with an iced chai latte, slipping away to
            the Catskills to recharge at a nice, old bed and breakfast, hiking
            with my more-athletic friends in the Adirondacks, or stopping by the
            many farmers' markets of the Hudson Valley.

          <p>
            Locals can login via desktop or mobile to access the platform and

            manage the event in realtime. This virtual platform complements the
            in-person experience by providing a seamless way for locals to
            engage with the fundraiser from anywhere.

              <span class="text-primary font-semibold">RCOS</span> is is a community
              of motivated students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who develop
              open source projects under the guidance of experienced instructors
              and student mentors.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            When it scaled up to hundreds of students enrolled every semester,
            and dozens of projects always in active development, RCOS required a
            more robust solution for managing its operations. That's where my
            expertise came in.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created and currently maintain RCOS.io, the central hub for all
            RCOS activity. It tracks enrolled students, faculty advisors,
            projects, project teams across semesters, meetings, event
            attendance, and more. The web application is built with Django and
            hosted extremely inexpensively. Since I was a part of RCOS during my
            RPI days and owe much of my development and leadership skills to the
            experience, I am committed to giving back to the community by
            maintaining this platform for free.
