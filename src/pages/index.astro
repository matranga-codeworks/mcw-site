    question: "What does custom software development cost?",
    answer:
      "Project costs vary based on complexity and scope, typically ranging from $10,000 for simple business tools to $75,000+ for fully comprehensive systems. I provide detailed estimates after understanding your specific needs and always discuss budget upfront to ensure we're on the same page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I structure payments around project milestones, so you're never paying for work that hasn't been completed. Most projects are split into 3-4 payments over the development timeline. An example payment schedule might look like this: 25% upfront, 50% at milestones, 25% at completion.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do projects typically take?",
    answer:
      "Simple applications usually take 6-12 weeks, while comprehensive business systems can take 3-6 months. I provide realistic timelines upfront and keep you updated on progress throughout.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my needs change during development?",
    answer:
      "I build flexibility into every project plan. Minor adjustments are included, and I'll always discuss costs for significant changes before implementing them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own the source code?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You'll own all code, designs, and intellectual property created for your project. I also provide documentation so you're never locked into working only with me.",
  },
  {
    question: "How involved will I need to be?",
    answer:
      "I handle all the technical complexity, but I'll need your input on business requirements and feedback during development. Most clients spend 1-2 hours per week in meetings and reviews.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I specialize in integrating new solutions with your current tools and databases. I'll assess your existing setup during our initial consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if something breaks after launch?",
    answer:
      "I include a 90-day warranty on all work, and I offer ongoing maintenance plans for long-term support. Since I'm local, I can respond quickly when you need help.",
  },

  {
    question: "What if we're not happy with the results?",
    answer:
      "I work in phases with regular check-ins specifically to prevent this. You'll see and approve everything before we move forward. My goal is building long-term relationships, not one-time projects.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have references?",
    answer:
      "I'm happy to provide references from previous clients and showcase relevant work samples during our consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts?",
    answer:
      "Yes! I offer discounts for non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and churches. Let's discuss your specific situation during our consultation.",
  },

              Engineering at a healthcare technology company, with a dual degree
              from RPI in Computer Science & Information Technology and Web
              Science, and 5+ years of deep experience building systems that
              local businesses like yours depend on every day. Now I'm bringing
              that expertise directly to local businesses in our community.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a NY Capital Region resident for the past 7 years, I'm invested
              in seeing our local businesses thrive. When you work with me,
              you're not just hiring a developer‚Äîyou're partnering with someone
              who cares about your success and is right here in the community
              when you need support.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me coworking in Troy over iced
              chai, hiking in the Catskills, or exploring Hudson Valley farmers'
              markets.

              <p>
                <span class="text-primary font-semibold">RCOS</span> is is a community
                of motivated students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who develop
                open source projects under the guidance of experienced instructors
                and student mentors.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              When it scaled up to hundreds of students enrolled every semester,
              and dozens of projects always in active development, RCOS required
              a more robust solution for managing its operations. That's where
              my expertise came in.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created and currently maintain RCOS.io, the central hub for all
              RCOS activity. It tracks enrolled students, faculty advisors,
              projects, project teams across semesters, meetings, event
              attendance, and more. The web application is built with Django and
              hosted extremely inexpensively. Since I was a part of RCOS during
              my RPI days and owe much of my development and leadership skills
              to the experience, I am committed to giving back to the community
              by maintaining this platform for free.
